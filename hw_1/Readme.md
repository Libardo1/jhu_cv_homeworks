# First Homework

## Problem 1

### Goal

Implement an object recognition system.

### Solution

The system was build using 110 threshold for binorization. The comparison of objects were made using
the roundness criteria only with threshold of 0.04.

The results can be seen on the following picture. On the left is the original file with the images of objects
to find and on the right are the images where the objects were detected. The pairs of images show the matched objects
their orientation on both images and the center of mass of the object.
